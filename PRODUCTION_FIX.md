# IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION FIX

## Quick Solution - Use Google OAuth Only

The issue is likely with the credentials provider causing server configuration errors. Here's an immediate fix:

### Option 1: Disable Email Login in Production (Recommended)

Add this environment variable in Vercel:
```
ENABLE_CREDENTIALS_AUTH=false
```

This will disable email/password login in production and only allow Google OAuth, which is more reliable.

### Option 2: Use Simplified Auth Configuration

If you want to completely avoid the issue, replace your `auth.ts` with the simplified version:

1. Backup your current `auth.ts`
2. Replace it with `auth-simple.ts` content
3. This removes all database dependencies and only uses Google OAuth

### Option 3: Test Credentials in Production

If you want to test email login, use these test credentials in production:
- Email: `habibrazeg23@gmail.com`
- Password: `test123`

### Immediate Steps:

1. **Add to Vercel Environment Variables:**
   ```
   ENABLE_CREDENTIALS_AUTH=false
   ```

2. **Redeploy your application**

3. **Test Google OAuth only:**
   - Go to your production site
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Should work without server configuration errors

4. **For email login later:**
   - Set `ENABLE_CREDENTIALS_AUTH=true` in Vercel
   - Ensure database connection is working
   - Test with the hardcoded credentials first

### Why This Works:

- Google OAuth doesn't require database connections
- It's handled entirely by NextAuth and Google
- No server-side validation or database queries
- More reliable in serverless environments like Vercel

### Next Steps After Google OAuth Works:

1. Verify all environment variables are correct
2. Test database connectivity separately
3. Gradually re-enable email authentication
4. Add proper user management with database

This approach will get your authentication working immediately in production.
